# The config includes:
# * an instruction to use /mnt/workdir/containers for Docker data
# * a workaround to reenable OOB on Oracle DB container.
#   See https://github.com/gvenzl/oci-oracle-xe/issues/43
#   Timeout handling requires some networking features and
#   the docker userland proxies lack handling of these features,
#   so we have to disable docker userland proxies.
